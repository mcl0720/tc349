Hosted version of this website: meldru20.info

I have included my wireframes as png images in the "wireframes" directory.
I used software Balsamiq to do my wireframes as I am not all that familiar
with photoshop, nor do I have a license for the software. 

My cardsorting was done in week 5 when it was first requested 
(you can find my results in that directory of my repo). I kept a 
similar layout but decided to cut some sections to keep the content 
concise. Mainly, the whole "Media" section was dropped. 

Last note. Technically the website exists as "one page" however, the
content is really broken up into 4-6 separate pages. As I was 
developing I felt that the user experience would be enhanced by
preventing full page loads and to create a link-scrollable site.
If this website existed on a more structured web framework I would
have most likely set up the detail sections to be pulled as background
requests as needed.
