		<h1>Personal Website</h1>
		<h2>Overall Design:</h2>
		<p>
			For my final project I would like to develop a personal website. The concept will be to provide some background information about myself,
			but to also provide a hub of information about program development. Most of the information will be focused on website development since 
			that is where most of my practical experience lies. The content that will be accessible on the site is grouped and listed in the table below.
		</p>
		<table>
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>Me</th>
					<th>Samples</th>
					<th>Worth Sharing</th>
					<th>Media</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>Bio</td>
					<td>Scripting Examples</td>
					<td>Dev Links</td>
					<td>Images</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Projects</td>
					<td>CSS Tricks</td>
					<td>Cool Internets</td>
					<td>Video</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
		<p>
			My card sorting lined up exactly with the group card sorting session. There was a discussion concerning the placement of "Dev Links." 
			Ultimately, the current placement was decided as the best choice.
